This docker container can be used to quickly get a
[WeeWX](http://weewx.com) instance up and running.

## Running ##

The easiest way to start the container is to create a
`docker-compose.yml` similar to the following.  If you use a
serial port to connect to your weather station, make sure the
container has permissions to access the port.

Modify any paths or devices as needed:

```yaml
---
name: "weewx"

services:
  weewx:
    image: felddy/weewx:5
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./data
        target: /data
    devices:
      - "/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0"
```

1. Create a directory on the host to store the configuration and database files:

    ```console
    mkdir data
    ```

1. If this is the first time running weewx, use the following command to start
   the container and generate a configuration file:

    ```console
    docker compose run --rm weewx
    ```

1. The configuration file will be created in the `data` directory.  You should
   edit this file to match the setup of your weather station.

1. When you are satisfied with configuration the container can be started in the
   background with:

    ```console
    docker compose up --detach
    ```

## Upgrading ##

1. Stop the running container:

    ```console
    docker compose down
    ```

1. Pull the new images from the Docker hub:

    ```console
    docker compose pull
    ```

1. Update your configuration file (a backup will be created):

    ```console
    docker compose run --rm weewx station upgrade
    ```

1. Read through the new configuration and verify.
   It is helpful to `diff` the new config with the backup.  Check the
   [WeeWX Upgrade Guide](http://weewx.com/docs/upgrading.htm#Instructions_for_specific_versions)
   for instructions for specific versions.

1. Start the container up with the new image version:

    ```console
    docker compose up --detach
    ```

## Migrating ##

If you are migrating a WeeWX installation, you need to configure the logger to
write to the console. Add the following to your `weewx.conf` file to see the log
output in the container logs:

```ini
[Logging]
    [[root]]
        level = INFO
        handlers = console,
```

## Installing WeeWX Extensions ##

If arguments are passed to the container, they are forwarded on to the
[`weectl`](https://weewx.com/docs/5.1/utilities/weectl-about/) command.  This
can be used to install extensions:

```console
docker compose run --rm weewx \
  extension install --yes \
  https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-windy/archive/master.zip
```

```console
docker compose run --rm weewx \
  extension install --yes \
  https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-mqtt/archive/master.zip
```

## Installing Python Packages ##

To install and persist Python packages, use the `pip` command. The libraries
will be installed into the `data` volume, ensuring they persist between
container restarts.

```console
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint pip weewx \
  install git+https://github.com/felddy/weewx-home-assistant@v1.0.0
```

## Image tags ##

The images of this container are tagged with [semantic
versions](https://semver.org) that align with the [version and build of
WeeWX](https://weewx.com/docs.html) that they support.

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended that users use the major version tag: `:5` Using the major
> tag will ensure that you receive the most recent version of the software that
> is compatible with your saved data, and prevents inadvertent upgrades to a new
> major version.

| Image:tag | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|`felddy/weewx:5`| The most recent image matching the major version number.  Most users will use this tag. |
|`felddy/weewx:5.1`| The most recent image matching the major and minor version numbers. |
|`felddy/weewx:5.1.0`| An exact image version. |

See the [tags tab](https://hub.docker.com/r/felddy/weewx/tags) on Docker
Hub for a list of all the supported tags.

## Volumes ##

| Mount point | Purpose        |
|-------------|----------------|
| `/data`     | [WeeWX root](https://weewx.com/docs/5.1/usersguide/where/#location-of-weewx-components) directory |

## Building from source ##

Build the image locally using this git repository as the [build context](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#git-repositories):

```console
docker build \
  --tag felddy/weewx:5.1.0 \
  https://github.com/felddy/weewx-docker.git#develop
```

## Cross-platform builds ##

To create images that are compatible with other platforms you can use the
[`buildx`](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) feature of
Docker:

1. Copy the project to your machine using the `Clone` button above
   or the command line:

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/felddy/weewx-docker.git
    cd weewx-docker
    ```

1. Build the image using `buildx`:

    ```console
    docker buildx build \
      --platform linux/amd64 \
      --output type=docker \
      --tag felddy/weewx:5.1.0 .
    ```
